# Theta Tau Storyline
## Introduction:
You can choose your characters name
You wake up to attend the Theta Tau trials in your room. You've been wanting to join the House of Hammer and Tongs as you've been a skill fighter and you want to protect the city during the Great Greek War.
You are late to the trials and find the trial destroyed and dead and injured bodies, and an on the verge of death Kewis Lemper.
He tells you a familiar face was here and stole everything we stand for
Initially there is no background info for Boss 3 it will slowly be revealed throughout the game
The all knowing Grandmaster, Kewis Lemper, assigns you the mission of finding all sacred items that were stolen and return the PMs safe and sound since you are the last remaining fighter from trials
All current members of theta tau are away due to the Great Greek war with competing fraternities

Rising Action:
Waves and the 2 boss fights
Once assigned the mission by Kewis Lemper, you are given time to gear up. 
You are given 3 options of armor to choose from. Light weight armor (speed bonus but lowered defense), Medium weight armor (balanced build), and heavy weight armor (increased defense but lowered speed).
You are given 3 options for a weapon. A dagger (shorter range and lower damage but faster attack speed), Short sword (balanced damage with slightly more range than the dagger and slower attack speed than the dagger), and Great sword (Longer range with more damage but slower attack speed than the short sword)
After gearing up you start to head out but an alarm sounds that signals an attack on the city.
There will be two waves of enemies coming from the entrance to the city. Wave 1 will have 6-10 enemies and Wave 2 will have 12-15. Each enemy will drop 1 coin.
After both waves the first boss will show up.
Once the first boss is beaten it will drop the gear and a shop is made accessible to the player in the city.
The player will then head out to save the PMs and end up in Lebron's enclosure.
There will be two waves exactly like the first boss but just slightly harder enemies.
Second boss will show up Lebrons enclosure after the two waves.
Once the second boss is beaten Lebron reappears from the pineapple house and acts as the second shop just like after the first boss.
The second boss will drop the stolen Hammer and Tongs. (Stats are yet to be decided)
After the second boss you will travel to find the third and final boss.

Climax:
You find yourself before the Bridge of 150+1 Stones
Reinforcements show up and ask if you need their help. The Player can say yes or no.
If the Player says yes the reinforcements will follow you onto the bridge. 
The boss shows up knocking a few people into the golden water. 
Sides of the bridge get destroyed and you get trapped and that initiates the fight.
You defeat Boss 3 and his true identity is revealed. He was a founding member of the House of Hammer and Tongs, a renowned weapons specialist and is known for his creations. He was removed as he slowly branch from Theta Tauâ€™s ethics and morals
Its revealed that he was possessed by a symbiote

Falling action:
You free all PMs and you get an award ceremony to join Theta Tau, you are titled the hero of the City of Theta Tau.
